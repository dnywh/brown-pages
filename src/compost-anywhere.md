This page is a toolkit for investigating a local area’s composting facilities, resources, and programmes. In other words: it’s a guide to how we build out the guides on this very website.

A full guide is coming soon. The following is a summary of strategies:

- Connect with local <a href="https://sharewaste.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShareWaste</a> hosts, if available in your area. They often know the local government policies and movements when it comes to composting.
- Visit a local community garden or urban farm. Simply entering one of those two phrases into Google Maps will get you surprisingly far.
- Connect with a representative of the local environment or sanitation department. Composting programmes are usually run at local government level: council, municipal, or county.
