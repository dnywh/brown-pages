Some public areas of Cusco have a dedicated organics waste bin. See Mercado San Blas and some of the plazas within Centro Histórico. Unfortunately, the separated organic bins are are often contaminated with non-organic rubbish, so our confidence in those food scraps getting composted is is low.

That said, the state government is making a serious effort with its QOSQO RECICLA program. They are often providing information at plazas.

## Private options

Some apartment buildings and businesses are serviced by <a href="https://qosqomposta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qosqomposta</a>, an organic waste collection service.
