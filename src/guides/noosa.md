## Drop-off points

[Noosa Community Garden](https://www.facebook.com/NoosaCommunityGarden) accepts food scraps at any time. They are located just [behind the Noosaville Library](https://goo.gl/maps/9vUyxRdNmBbj3LwX9). Place your food scraps in the green bin, just inside the fence (but reachable from the outside).

## Workshops and resources

{{ council }} runs regular workshops on at-home composting. You can find these on the councilâ€™s [Garden Waste and Composting](https://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/environment-waste/waste-recycling/garden-waste-composting) page. Events on this page are often buried so scour carefully.

The council also maintains a dedicated [Composting and Worm Farms](https://www.noosa.qld.gov.au/waste-recycling/composting-worm-farms-1) page with related resources.
