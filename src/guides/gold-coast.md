## Paid options

Local business _Seed the Ground_ runs a food waste subscription service for residents in Miami and Burleigh called [Swap and Go](https://www.seedtheground.com.au/swap-and-go). For $4.50 a week subscribers receive a compost caddy which can be swapped out at a local Swap Station.

Subscribers can also pick up bags of compost from their Swap Station once a month.

## Resources

{{ council }} maintains a list of [local community gardens](https://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/Things-to-do/Parks-gardens-reserves/Community-gardens), each with their own evolving food scrap drop-off policy. Try contacting your local garden about their latest policy.
