By contributing your organic waste, you’re not just reducing landfill; you’re enriching the garden that serves as a refuge for plants, insects, and people alike. Our compost heaps are a labor of love, transforming what was once discarded into rich, fertile soil that nurtures everything from tomatoes to wildflowers. We operate with a deep sense of gratitude for the natural world and the contributions of our community members. If you’re new to composting, we’d be happy to give you tips on how to make the most of your scraps!",
